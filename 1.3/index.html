	While it was understood that we were to copy information to use as a filler for our websites. Due to being behind and being comfortable in both tangent and writing, I felt it was important to combine the processes. It is important to note that the tangent prose that comes before the Site Proposal, it is intended for another class in a completely different mode of presentation. I included it here because of its relation to my own site proposal.
</i>
</p>
<br>
<p>
	The internet is a wild abstract of communication and information. I feel it has worn its welcome, ringing a dial-upstream drowning salmon swimming gapping gaze. Grotesque its content, for the most treaded hyperlinks and front pages are the dirtiest, gross in some sort of emotion, oh how bored we've become to yell obscenity in anonymity down watering wells for echo, and on the disassociated honesty and comfort of a couch or bed. A world too proud to work in their underwear, but perfectly fine spending their moments asynchronously hanging about and wasting the final hours of energy in their stinky human spent nakedness. It's almost as if in our distance from each other we have learned to love the stillwater puddle palm of fluid pager digits. Lying there naked in silent attachment and devotion on dawns dew and nights blanket. I hear the phone ring, I hear MTV blaring, some generational crier Siren song dialup tones wash over in rolling crashes of bytes and bits on the distant shores of anywhere but elsewhere. We used to wander and now we scroll, to consider the candlelight flicker to the dim cold room on some archaic imagination to anywhere but elsewhere. We used to wander, now we scroll, when does the printing press, the machine to consume architecture do so? I transcend my humanity in 3d vessels communing with wander strangers who have now become the fenced bleat, the farmer provides us grass for our wool. Oh the graze is sweet, but I feel like as time has shown the potential might be gone if you listen closely for the artillery pop, whistle, and boom. There be wars only history will write of, for we tread into an unknown, but you know it's just another telephone when they are dragging Grandmother's final walk into the sinking sand of time, records of retina scans, and the motions between views and likes. What the internet should have been is likely else, but that is the pessimistic, doomer boomer meme, because Grandmother would have never chosen to sink without such a now. The mass communication by internet would not be as popularly addictive without the diluted quick byte information chew and digest without us losing the wander to the scroll. We used to wander and bleat in cold mountain mists, freely picking the long strands that piqued our interest. But would there be so many of us on the mountain? would the mountain be good or free if the mountain were the stable to our farm? would the cool mists tend to us like farmer apparition of seeming authority by nature and some Darwinian obsession of the superiority over other parts? Would Grandmother be so inclined to fancy the mountain echo, is it not easier to run the congested farm on the trough of feeds and scrolls. Are we so different from tweeting birds in branches and flocks, or those grazing in the Staples parking lot, the pigeons, seagulls, starlings, and finches resting about in dirt baths lounging to the longitudinal and latitude of our information environment? Are we so different from the trees or the rocks? I want to be a cliff rock, moss riddled and prose, in vista point, seemingly lose, waiting to fall to the erosion and some new world below, I'll possibly break, but I'll probably break more in rolling tumble and splendor, just waiting to fall out of this panopticon ledge and from the cell and trough I share with my Grandmother. I would say that a human comfort, I'd say a good home is always one that was a good home, but Grandma this isn't home, this is not our nest or food, this is not the spawning pool we're from nor should it be where we leave the remains in contract to a memory machine, salmon we swam up the wrong stream. I wonder do they still make photo albums, does Amazon grow these photo albums, do they have pops, skips, and crackles, do they spin dial on sun dial the hour has struck, like the sticks we used to swing in our first extension of self, Trans human we swing in the dark with our blind eye forward holding out a suspension of the extended mirrored and rapidly calculated mind.
</p>
<p>
	With this all considered, it is important to believe that this is the greatest trajectory we could ask for. The revolution won't be on the backs of bodies on a frontline but on the momentum of innovations and subversion as we burrow deep into the digital, away from ourselves and the irons motion.
</p>
<p>
	In this regard I believe that we live in an Amazon prime time for experimentation and subversion, we are doomed if we slide down like burger beef who used to moo and sit just before the rain, to fund our world a digital opulent panopticon selling ourselves for fast fashion DLC. Today is the day we stand with soil in our hands, and those many around sifting hour-glassless to the wind, seeing where the grains toss. If motion of iron found us here, then we should dig deeper and rift further, and the motion of iron will traverse, but there has to be a place where the motion of iron can not follow and it is here, we transcend ourselves and leave behind the doomed poisoned shell, the industrialized soul and its motion in iron. I feel like park bench cane swinging pointing tales to say that it used to feel different back in another day, so what has changed if not for better and worse, and for worse a better to ask to where will we go, when does the printing press replace the scroll.
</p>
<p>
	When does the printing press replace the scroll, so wonder as if not to assume, but I believe the question in mind is best to aim to consider where will we go and how will we get there? And it is not to say this is where we will go and how to get there, but we could go this way, so a conjecture, a prophecy removed of manifesto, an imagination for cold lobbies of another waiting room, ringing tower bells, ringing doorbells, ringing landlines, ringing cellphones, ringing monitor buzz beneath all elsewhere, ringing silence in a new kind of hell.
</p>
<br>
<h2>Site Proposal</h2>
<p>
	The website is projected into two limited forms that begin to abstract the potentials for the liminal considerations of the web. These forms in no way are expectations of form but more a question of it. Coming from the same output these forms will project the website into the 3d space through a VR application and webGL page. These forms will be accompanied by a traditional 2d screen-based website from which the 3d spaces will reorganize and contrast to abstractions and extrapolations of pages and elements into 3d projection. This a question to imagine the efficiencies of conventions that will likely remain and the developments of conventions into new forms outside of its traditional dimensions and constraints. This conjecture and question assume the progression from the keyboard and the screen entirely, to imagine a world augmented or immersed into a digital projection. Although this seems like a hefty thesis consideration and goal, I can assure that this is closer related to a light-hearted depiction that is considerate to the possibility of futures unimagined that would render such a question into the eavesdrop of ‘didn’t see the evidence of tomorrow.’ In this way it becomes a sentiment of conjecture that reveals the biases and values placed on facets of technology that might rather paint a picture of the past over its goal of a question of the future.
</p>
<p>
	After reading the Site Proposal description I made severe assumptions about what the site proposal would allow. While this proposal was solely to fill up space for the submission of this web page, it still could be applied to the redesign of an old site. Though this proposal could be used in a later assignment as investigation, experimentation, and reflection. The assignments reusing content makes a lot of sense in hindsight, as it is a means to produce developed websites and focus more on the designing rather than the content.
